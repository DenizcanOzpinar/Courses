To run Sort of Things Desktop project

script.sql file is provided to re-create database.
But i don't know how it works but probbably you need to change ip, username and password that in sqlManager.java file.
In case that it will not find needed libraries there is folder named jarFiles that contains jars that used in the project.

Additionly if re-creating data base will not help to connect app to database you can download LogMeIn Hamachi and join network called
cs434network
and password is
cs434password
If my computer is not open at the time you trying to connect pls email me denizcan.ozpinar@ozu.edu.tr

The barcodes are saved to the barcodes folder in project
After that you can just run project.
